# Architrave

A design tool for planning and budgeting of Interior Design Projects. Backend Code.

## Overview

Architrave is a design tool that provides a solution for planning and budgeting interior design projects. It is specifically designed for designers and hobbyists who want to manage their projects efficiently.

With Architrave, users can create and manage multiple projects, upload images, and create moodboards for each project. During the creation of each moodbard, users may use files from their own asset library or those provided by Architrave via external API's. They can also extract colors from the images to create color schemes and palettes, or browse the curated color collections created by Architrave. This feature makes it easy for users to create a cohesive look for their projects. The budgeting feature of Architrave allows users to track expenses for each moodboard and the entire project. This feature is particularly useful for designers who need to stay within budget constraints. Furthermore, users may create their own library of assets for future use, store them in categories for easy access, and add external links and costings for budgeting purposes.
